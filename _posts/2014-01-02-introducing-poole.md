title: Kicking off a daily microblog

Inspired by [David Hogg's blog protocol](http://hoggresearch.blogspot.com/) and [Dan Halperin's adaptation](http://blog.halper.in/), I've set up a daily microblog.  Unlike Hogg's blog, my self-imposed rules won't disallow talking about non-research topics, because I'm involved in a lot of [interesting](http://data.washington.edu/incubator) [non-research](http://www.coursera.org/course/datasci) [activities](http://github.com/uwescience).

I set up this blog in 5 minutes using Poole and github pages.  The site is rendered using the Jekyll static HTML generator because it is supported natively by github pages -- you don't have to pre-render the HTML and commit that to the repo.   Ignoring github's advice, I didn't bother installing Jekyll locally for the sake of previewing material before it's published.  A "micro" blog shouldn't require firing up a ruby-based web server just to check that the markdown has no typos.  But also, the amazon prose.io allows editing, committing, and pushing text files managed in github directly in your browser.  No need for any local software.  I can post from my mobile device or someone else's computer.  All the comforts of blogspot, etc., but with the simplicity, control, and portability of static HTML generators.
