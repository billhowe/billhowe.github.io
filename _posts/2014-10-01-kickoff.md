title: Kicking off a daily microblog

Inspired by [David Hogg's blog protocol](http://hoggresearch.blogspot.com/) and [Dan Halperin's adaptation](http://blog.halper.in/), I've set up a daily microblog.  Unlike Hogg's blog, my self-imposed rules won't disallow talking about non-research topics, because I'm involved in a lot of [interesting](http://data.washington.edu/incubator) [non-research](http://www.coursera.org/course/datasci) [activities](http://github.com/uwescience).

I set up this blog in 5 minutes using [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) and [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).  The site is rendered using the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static HTML generator because it is supported natively by github pages -- you don't have to pre-render the HTML and commit that to the repo.   Ignoring github's advice, I didn't bother installing [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) locally for the sake of previewing material before it's published.  A "micro" blog shouldn't require firing up a ruby-based web server just to check that the markdown has no typos.  But also, the amazing [prose.io](http://prose.io/#billhowe) allows editing, committing, and pushing your github-managed text files directly in your browser.  No need for any local software.  I can post from a mobile device or someone else's computer.  All the heady comforts of blogspot, etc., but with the simplicity, control, portability, and street cred of a static HTML generator.
